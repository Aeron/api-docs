# Messages

The Messages resource represents all the different messages in Flowdock. Message is a sub-resource for Flow, so it should always be accessed in that context.
```
`/flows/:organization/:flow_name/messages`.
```

* *[Send A Message](messages-post)*
* *[List Messages](messages-get)*

The message resource is used for a lot of things, you can for example:

* Set user status
* Upload a file
* Comment a team inbox item

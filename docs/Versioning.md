# Versioning

> NOTE: The API is currently in BETA, versioning is not enforced, and breaking changes may occur!

* The desired API version can be included in the URL. See [the REST API docs](rest) for the URL format.
* You can use all APIs without defining the version in the URL, the version will then default to the latest.
* The Flowdock API can change without the version number being incremented. These changes will however always be backwards compatible.
* If a non-backwards compatible change is introduced, the API version is incremented.
* Whenever there is an API change on it's way it will be announced well beforehand.
